18,iurayy5,Avatar: The Way of Water | Official Trailer,"As a movie fan in general, and based on James Cameron’s track record, I will of course be seeing this movie, probably opening weekend. 

BUT… this trailer didn’t do anything to get me excited for the movie. It kind of seems like the same thing as t he first one with kids.  “You’re an outsider, we don’t accept you, oh no the evil alien Americans are coming to destroy our magical world because they don’t understand it.”  

Like I said, it’s James Cameron. His results can’t be denied, and on a big screen/IMAX/3D, it should be visually stunning.  My fear is if the story doesn’t catch people, and the 3D isn’t as revolutionary as the first one, this might underperform, maybe messing with the future movies. 

I’m going to see the movie and will reserve judgement until then, but I don’t know if this trailer gets many more people to the theater than were already planning on seeing the movie.",490,1667396102.0

- instead of Jake and the other human avatars being the outsiders in the Na'Vi clan, now the original Na'Vi clan are the outsiders in the water clan and have to gain acceptance, etc
- exploring the wonders of the underwater world and it's new creatures instead of exploring the jungle world
- teaching the kids how to hunt, fly, etc instead of teaching Jake
- flying skimwings instead of flying banshees
- the giant tulkun creature is like the big boss sea creature instead of the giant leonopteryx
- Quartich and generic military dudes as the villain again but now they've got avatars
- humans have another base but it's bigger
- crab mech instead of land mech
- submarines / small attack boats instead of attack helicopters
- giant ocean battleship end boss instead of giant warplane end boss
- defending the water Na'Vi holy sites instead of the jungle Na'Vi holy sites
- it's looking like I bet there will be an initial encounter where the Na'Vi get their asses handed to them by the bigger badder human military, and then they harness the power of Eywa and it's fauna which helps them destroy the big warship, etc

I just hope and trust that there's a lot more to this and it's going to go in some new directions that lead us into a bigger and more interesting arc for the next 3 or however many movies. I mean it's 3+ hours long, which is longer than the first movie so there's gotta be more going on and they're just showing the basics that are familiar from the first film to get asses into seats...",224,1667399165.0

Of course, this isn't due to the resolution itself, it's the bitrate doing the heavy lifting. But I really don't get why they don't upload them in 1440p at least. I know some creators upscale their 1080p videos to 1440p for upload just to get the increased bit rate, and it makes a world of difference.

223,iuskh8n,Avatar: The Way of Water | Official Trailer,"Cameron regarding his perceived failings of the DCEU and MCU:

“When I look at these big, spectacular films — I’m looking at you, Marvel and DC — it doesn’t matter how old the characters are, they all act like they’re in college. They have relationships, but they really don’t. They never hang up their spurs because of their kids. The things that really ground us and give us power, love, and a purpose? Those characters don’t experience it, and I think that’s not the way to make movies.”

They're perfectly on track to hit their target but I don't know why people are shocked, video games aren't the only industry to have crunch periods and it is a massive movie with a lot of technical shots to pull off, and they had also been working on other projects such as some parts of Rings of Power over the last while too which meant resources were not in full punch for Avatar. Now they're all go on this to get it out the door.

A pair of mildly successful Fantastic Four films. And the MCU had already begun, with Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk.

All of that happened in just the decade before Avatar came out.

It was also occurring about 8 years prior to the release of commercial VR so it was a brand new experience for everyone.

There's subtle differences in real life physics that CGI doesn't replicate well.  And likely there will always be something.  Your brain has expectation of what it should look like.  As others have mentioned, it's the uncanny valley.

For me, the scene where one of them is tackling the other @ 1:30, it feels off, even though if you take any individual frame it looks okay.  It's not just the characters though, it's also the environment - the water and sand look off, the characters feel like they're hollow shells while the motion looks a little too smooth.

Same @ 1:53 where the two of them are climbing what appears to be ""higher ground"" in the ship.  The movement of everything doesn't match to someone actually struggling to escape that scenario.  They're supposed to be struggling, but it just looks like they're climbing up no problem like Spider-Man.

359,iur7t0i,Avatar: The Way of Water | Official Trailer,"In the first movie, Grace (Sigourney Weaver) is dying and they try to save her at the tree of souls, by trying to transfer her conciousness from her human body into her Avatar hybrid clone body thing that the humans had made for her to interact with the Na'vi.

For whatever reason, Eywa, the deity/""god"" of the Na'vi planet, chose not to (or perhaps couldn't) transfer Grace's conciousness into the clone body, and so she dies in the movie. Later on this process is attempted again for Jake, and is successful.

So perhaps, because Eywa is essentially an interconnection of living organism's across the entire planet, kind of like neurons in a brain, maybe Grace's conciousness was still ""alive"" inside of Eywa.

My guess would be that because the Na'vi ""commune"" with Eywa using their hair tentacles ~~which also apparently are akin to sexual organs~~, maybe Eywa has put a part of Grace's conciousness into Neytiri from this communion, so that Neytiri and what I presume is Jake's child, is also partly Grace.

Of course this is all just my complete guess from watching the trailer, as I haven't read anything about Avatar 2. So I could be completely wrong! I didn't even know the child was supposed to be Sigourney Weavers character, until someone in the comments here said it.",272,1667394623.0

He's done some stuff with the lore obviously, but only after doing the first few books, and now he's mostly just making it up as he goes along. He might kinda sorta know how things will end, but he's not sure how to get there.

Tolkien didn't have to do that - he imagined the world and a lot of its overall history first, and then basically just came up with stories to expand on some of that history. I think a lore bible (or just a ton of charts with character names/relationships and stuff like that) is really common in the fantasy genre, and IMO is absolutely *necessary* unless your book only has a handful of characters or something.",17,1667423924.0
