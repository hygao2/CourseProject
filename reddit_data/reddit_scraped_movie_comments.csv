Cops tell the judge even they don’t know where she is supposed to go, and then leave while she’s getting into her car. We barely get one second of their reaction when her car blows up, showing the cops look back. It’s not enough to tell their emotions or loyalty, and is likely a deliberate choice by Director Nolan. 

He just set up the fact that the police are compromised with Gordon explaining that the Joker has someone who can get inside the police commissioner’s office, right as he drinks poisoned alcohol. He’s not going to immediately reveal the crooked cops, and will tease out how so many were compromised.
