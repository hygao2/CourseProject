Cops tell the judge even they don’t know where she is supposed to go, and then leave while she’s getting into her car. We barely get one second of their reaction when her car blows up, showing the cops look back. It’s not enough to tell their emotions or loyalty, and is likely a deliberate choice by Director Nolan. 

He just set up the fact that the police are compromised with Gordon explaining that the Joker has someone who can get inside the police commissioner’s office, right as he drinks poisoned alcohol. He’s not going to immediately reveal the crooked cops, and will tease out how so many were compromised.

It's not just that he's good, his performance completely changes the tone of the movie and catapults Dark Knight from a decent comic book film to a masterpiece. Without him it would be a completely different and honestly far more forgettable film.

The interrogation scene is a great example of this- if you ignore Ledger and just watch Christian Bale's performance in that scene about the most you can say is he yells and growls a lot, which pretty much seems to be the only thing he does when playing batman. But the way Ledger maintains control of the scene is so smart and so well executed that it  makes Bale's performance look way better- suddenly he's not just doing his one angry batman voice, he's impotently raging at a lunatic who knows exactly how to push his buttons.

I think that is the hallmark of a great supporting role- you don't just produce a memorable character, you do so in a way which make the leads looks better.",131,1659918855.0

Bardem's portrayal of the character is arguably the greatest portrayal of a psychopath ever put to film, far above even Ledger's Joker. And Landa's portrayal shows a character who treats everything as an interrogation, a character who's so charming that he somehow ends up being likeable but also a character that immediately induces tension and even a bit of fear towards him. Out of the three, I'd say Landa's performance is the most unpredictable and therefore the most tension-inducing one. Bardem's the most realistic and outright scary performance.

As much as people don’t like to admit it, the politics of the Oscar campaigns is super significant on the outcome, and people tend to vote for who has the best “narrative” behind the win. 

I think Ledger’s death works in his favor in this hypothetical because it makes it the Academy’s last chance to ever award him versus Waltz and Bardem who presumably will have a chance again.

If any other actor had played the character as written it would have made for a pretty average villain, true, but equally I don't feel like Waltz is doing anything special as an actor here; he's just turning the charm up to 11 despite the despicable character he's playing, and it's only because of that juxtaposition that Landa is such an acclaimed character.

Heath Ledger's Joker on the other hand is this whole complete character that Ledger becomes. This isn't the naturally charming Heath Ledger of films like 10 Things I Hate About You, it's an entirely different persona he just disappears into.

All three performances were ""clean sweep"" annihilators, winning the vast majority of critics group awards plus the quartet of Critics Choice, Golden Globe, SAG, and BAFTA. In fact, let's include an extra two who mostly qualify for these parameters to make an absolute clusterfuck of a five-juggernaut category: Christian Bale in The Fighter and Christopher Plummer in Beginners. (Bale lost the BAFTA to Geoffrey Rush in the most British movie of all time, The King's Speech. Bale was so good in The Fighter as a druggy American they forgot he's actually British.) This is normally where you'd start, but since all five have the same ish credentials, we have to look elsewhere.

Let's start with money. Plummer is a completely obvious lock in his year but he wouldn't get a passing glance in this set of five in part due to his film's financial performance. Everyone in the Academy votes for the winner so you're asking a large body of people to vote for a film that made less than 20 million at the box office and didn't exactly catch additional steam once screeners were released. Yes it's true that he's old enough to have come over on the original Mayflower and yes he hadn't won shit in years prior. People generally need to watch the films to vote for the winner. A category this stacked, no one's going to care that Plummer's on death's door if they aren't watching the film. They've snubbed old people before, they'll snub old people again. (Not for nothing, but he later got nominated for a film he originally wasn't in. Pretty sure he was 800 years old then - didn't win.) The remaining four films had contextually successful box office performances so we aren't eliminating anyone else just yet.

Let's move on to the next consideration - Ledger's dead ass. A lot of folks in this thread are referring to the posthumous nature of the performance as a strength. It really is anything but. Ledger's win is only the second performance to win an acting award, with seven additional dead losers clogging up the record books. Yes, Ledger's performance was so good that it transcended his deadness. This suddenly doesn't matter now that the field is completely saturated with top shelf performances. Add the ""comic book movie"" designation which the Academy is generally allergic to and you have a recipe for a quality snub.

We're down to three performances. It gets a little less scientific from here so keep that in mind as we move along. Our remaining contenders are all from financially successful films without any deads. Additionally, all three films were nominated for Best Picture. However, only one of these films won Best Picture and that's No Country for Old Men. This doesn't inherently matter but you definitely get some extra pull. The Fighter's year was widely seen as The King's Speech vs The Social Network. Inglourious Basterds' year was widely seen as The Hurt Locker vs Avatar. The Fighter and Inglourious Basterds both have legitimate claims for the bronze trophy in their years, but I think Inglourious Basterds is probably a surer pick due to less competition. But wait, we're talking about Best Supporting Actor, right? Yes, but we're also splitting hairs with some of the greatest performances of all time.

So now we're down to Waltz vs Bardem. Two terrifying performances from two terrifying auteurs (one of whom is brothers with Ethan Coen, a quitter). Frankly, it probably comes down to a coin toss. I speculate Bardem wins by a few votes, in large part because his film is winning Best Picture (and therefore increasing his profile). He's also a known commodity for voters, the vast majority of whom are seeing Waltz for the first time. It ain't fair and it's hardly scientific, but that's the Oscars for you.

So Bardem is my answer.",1,1659933061.0

Yes what ledger did with joker was amazing and one of the greatest turns as the character, but I think other actors could have pulled it off.

Hard disagree.  Robert Downey Jr. had all the buzz before Ledger died.  He was an already known actor and this was his big triumphant return from addiction, etc.  Yes Ledger was brilliant, but so was Downey in Tropic Thunder.  And ironically the Academy has been known to devalue performances in genre movies, particularly superhero movies.  

If Ledger doesn't die, Downey Jr. wins the Oscar.  But Ledger would've been a position like Leonardo DiCaprio where he was doing such good work consistently that he'd probably have won a future Oscar for some movie that likely wouldn't be as good a performance.",-3,1659973266.0

Bardem was absolutely chilling as Chigur in a way I hadn’t seen since Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs. It’s such an odd character, but he played it to perfection. 

Meanwhile, the way Waltz managed to play a purely evil Nazi in a coy and even silly way at times, yet keep him eerily menacing as well was masterful. 

Ledger was incredible, but had the freedom to go way over the top as the Joker given the genre and costumes/props/action that entails. I just think the other two did more with less.

Hans Landa feels mysterious because of how the movie portrays him, we learn new little things about him everytime he shows up on screen.

Except we didn't.  Heath Ledger portrayed a version of the joker that had never been seen in cinema or on tv before.  He redefined the character for coming generations.  Before his performance, I'd always imagined either the Nicholson joker or the animated tv show joker.  But after Heath's portrayal, they both seemed like parodies of his truer form.  His performance is likely the most iconic of all super villains, definitely most iconic of the three options given here.

Look I like his character and incidentally, No Country For Old Men, I think is easily the best movie of the bunch, but with how minimal his performance was and how strong the writing/craft of that movie was,...how much of it was his performance? If someone gave a minimal performance with bad writing, I think it falls apart. I do think Heath Ledger actually disappeared more into his role than Javier and I think if TDK was poorly written with Heath giving the *exact* same performance, it would still be a good performance. 

However, they both disappeared more into their roles than Waltz did for Landa. But then Landa was honestly the most nuanced character and the performance was more nuanced and had to showcase more range (much wider range of emotions for Landa than the other two characters).

None of his mannerisms and even the joker voice felt like him at all. He disappeared more into the role even beyond the makeup. Go watch Heath in interviews or literally any other movie. He really disappeared into the role, it's uncanny. 

Go watch an interview with Waltz, there’s still some mannerisms and way of speaking that feels like Waltz/Landa are the same and so I get what the person above is saying when he says it’s less of a reach. Think an actor putting on a foreign accent instead of just using their native accents. The latter is doing a bit less overall.

I don't think one can objectively choose what is better when actually analyzing all three, it's definitely not as simple as ""Waltz was better and no question"". Absolutely not and depends on what other strengths/factors you want to weigh against each other.",5,1659936460.0

Our reports had to detail; clothing worn on individuals involved, exact actions of individuals with time stamp from recorded incidents, body language, tone of voice, physical actions, verbatim dialog when recorded or paraphrased if not recorded/inaudible, time of day, location, weather and any other pertinent information.

Notice the typo and duplicate traffic violations, per the release date of the film her driver's license was expired, she has a California driver's license, notice the ""Last known location: Palisades, City of Gotham.  Notes:  Suspect is surprisingly strong and agile, approach with caution.""  Also she got charged for shoplifting when she was 12 and 13 (note she's younger in this film than she is in real life, she's actually born in 1982).  I can't make out much of anything on the *Wayne Enterprises - Applied Sciences Division* section on the right ""other than Fingerprint not on file.""  It looks like it's some sort of program log like ""identification complete, extreme ties complete, request sent, matching time, started capturing from scanner"" etc. Also [California driver's license numbers](https://i.imgur.com/Vg0LBTZ.jpg) consist of 1 letter first and 7 numbers next, hers is *CA-7864821051S*, I guess she was first issued a license when she was 4 in 1990?

”The suspect, Selina Kyle, refused to cooperate when approached by myself and Officer (???). When asked of her whereabouts at the time of the burglary, she refused to answer and instead laughed while mocking our uniforms. She displayed a short temper, when officer (???) remarked that we weren’t there to waste time, she said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but she kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing her hand shut in front of my face. After our questioning I heard her chuckle as we walked off. Before leaving we saw her trying to walk out of the store with approximately fifteen Milky Ways in her hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and said “Ma’am, you need to pay for those first.” At first she kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

The actor, William Fichtner, isn’t a bank manager babysitting mob money like in TDK, but rather a money launderer who has bearer bonds stolen by Deniro’s character and ultimately has his bodyguard tip off the cops about the heist, which I personally think is basically the plot equivalent to his line in TDK (*You have any idea who you’re stealing from? You and your friends are deaaaad!*). Regardless, Nolan pays homage to Mann’s movie with these little shout outs.

If you haven’t seen Heat yet it’s highly recommended. The shootout sequence is one of the best in movie history and law enforcement have used parts of it for training purposes regarding tactical reloads. The scene also foregoes dubs and retained the live audio of the gunfire through microphone placements on different streets of filming location to capture the sound of the blanks going off, giving it the most realistic sounding shootout ever.",472,1647115088.0

Bruce Wayne having TWO montage comebacks is 80s-style homage at best, but Nolan's trilogy was never to be in that light, it was supposed to be neo-noir Batman. The odd NEW villains that are never developed are also apparent patchwork from the beginning. Selena Kyle is just...some lady stealing; I mention her as she's the first new villain (IIRC) that is shown early on and it ends with her being anti-chaos and just teaming up with Batman and loving him. And it feels like she's a prop unlike Scarecrow and Joker from the previous films. 

Usually I think that a film like this can be saved by proper editing and cutting characters out, but I don't see that with TDK-Rises, it's so shallow across the board. I wanted to love this film as the last of the trilogy and I can't rewatch it.",11,1647118079.0

I've always thought that death was lame in the og comic, the doctor gets killed by one of the flying toy androids who snaps his neck 180 degrees. Which is just kinda... weird to be honest.

Meanwhile in the animated movie, it's Joker himself who kills the doctor, he breaks the coffen mug given to him in the show and he slashs his throat with it. Always thought the movie's version was much better than in the comic where it's the android doing it.",7,1651539542.0

Joker is generally well-liked, so I'd rather they have it than have nothing at all. Additionally, someone who only really watches comic-book movies but who enjoyed Joker might, upon hearing that it was inspired by Taxi Driver or King of Comedy, go check out one of those movies. It might also function as a broader gateway into more character-driven dramas for viewers who were previously only interested in blockbuster-type movies.

It's like those artist renditions of realistic Pokemon.

Joker was the same idea, but with using the Batman characters and lore as a framework, kind of like Detective Pikachu (which I admittedly haven't seen yet).

I found it incredibly refreshing as a comic ""adaptation""/origin story because you don't have to spend any time ""meeting"" the characters and can spend more time understanding, analyzing, and empathizing with them instead, which ultimately makes the movie more like a suspense/thriller/lite-horror because it feels much more real and possible, all the while knowing what/who he goes on to become in the comics",11,1651505198.0

>Just to be polite, he followed up by inquiring, “Oh, yes?

The other commenter said it felt like the comic stuff was painted on, but I almost feel like that would be better. Take the new Pattinson Batman. That movie felt like it was built from the ground up as a good detective movie (admittedly also quite derivative, but still good). Then, they added context to bring out the comic side. The city looked and felt like Gotham. The characters felt like they had history both with each other and individually.

Joker felt like they started with the comics and then kept taking things away. But they couldn’t decide what to take away and what to keep. For instance, the city itself is completely gone. You would never visually recognize the city in the movie as Gotham City. However, they felt the need to keep (and shoddily explain) Joker’s laugh. They hamfisted the Wayne’s in there and even showed them walk into Crime Alley, but they couldn’t bother to even reference any other comic characters. Could’ve had Gordon be the one trying to solve the murders. Show him in his younger days. But instead, we got detectives Burke and Garrity.

It's a great film, and I agree that it being almost 50 is not a big deal and does not even make it that old. While it is true that anyone remotely into film will watch Scorsese, to the point that Taxi Driver is one of the most stereotypical film-bro picks, that means nothing to younger audiences. Most of the people in my age group (20-somethings) have zero interest in anything like Taxi Driver, let alone Scorsese's newer works like Silence or The Irishman. Most of my friends that aren't explicitly ""movie people"" will pretty much only go to the theater a select few times a year, to see the biggest studio tentpoles. At this point, they're unlikely to even watch all of the MCU movies, even when they're streaming. If enough friends tell them to, maybe a small number of them will check out something like Parasite after it wins Best Picture, and then there's a chance they'll like it.

I mean, it's a story about an orphan growing up and trying to take revenge on a violent and corrupt system of governance and being stopped by a child of privilege. Sure it's more nuanced than that, but the core ideological dialectic is still very much present.

At the end of the day superheroes, especially when they act as vigilantes, are inherently a right-wing power fantasy. 

Moore is the only writer who has ever really addressed that issue seriously in my mind, and the work in which he does it is extremely cynical and devoid of hope, intentionally so. Because the real world existence or acceptance of superheroes as they're presented in comics would equate to admitting some people are inherently superior to others and have a right to take law and justice into their own hands.

I think it's okay to enjoy superhero stories and it's okay to write them as protagonists, because it's a fantasy medium, but translating the morals of those stories to the real world always comes with uncomfortable parallels.",15,1651504085.0

Shazam, Birds of Prey, and apparently the new Suicide Squad (the one with John Cena, not Will Smith) are all very fun and interesting movies that don’t fall into the trappings Snyder’s work did. I recommend checking those out at least. Aquaman and the first Wonder Woman are also pretty decent though still flawed in many ways.

As for The Batman, I was genuinely surprised that it came the closest to realizing what makes Batman an interesting and fun character since the 90s cartoon. It’s not perfect, but it has much more substance to it than you’d expect from watching the trailers.",14,1651505427.0

I personally like *The Dark Knight* more. I watched it in cinema two times, and at the end I was blown away by the thrill ride I had just witnessed on the silver screen. And I still almost feel that way when I rewatch it on Bluray at home.

I liked *The Batman*. It's a solid movie. But I will die on this hill: The movie doesn't need to be around 3 hours long. It just feels like a slog a lot of the time. Just cutting it down to 2 1/4 or even 2 1/2 hours would improve my watching experience immensely. But other than that, it's quite a good Batman story … just told at a veeeeeeery slow pace.

I think it's fair to say that The Dark Knight is a more classic film, and I think it's more easily digestible as well. I love The Batman, but it is a long movie and it drags on. I don't mind this to build the feel and mood of the world in the film, but plenty of people just want to get on with the story.

I think the Tumbler is the better batmobile, but The Batman has the better chase scene, and the better 'Holy shit that sounds insane' response from the engine.

I prefer The Batman's fighting. Pattinson is fast, and employs a variety of styles to win. He also took a bit of Affleck's enjoyment of the fight, that Bale lacked. Nolan's choreography is more 'showy' and definitely slower.

Joker is the better villain, but that's because he's a GOAT villain. But the Riddler made me uncomfortable as well.

In terms of aesthetic, I like the IMAX sequences of TDK. I get that Reeves wanted to use flawed lenses to bring character to the image, but in my opinion, I would have preferred more clarity at times.

Its almost from the beginning, about the ending of batman.

The Batman, Gets a lot closer to batman as a person. It doesnt ask if he should do what he does, but rather ""why"". And it does this much closer to him as a person. He is unsure of what he is doing and if he is doing any good. The Batman is the story of batman finding a purpose for himself.

How is that even in question though? There wouldn't be the movie without Ledger in the role. There is no instance or cut of the film that doesnt have Ledger in it. He is a big part of the movie. Its not like he was an afterthought or was cast as a replacement.


>The story is just okay outside of scenes with the Joker.

The story is basic for sure, but thats what makes it work. Its not overly complicated. It's a crime drama. It's a bit of a detective movie.  Thats why anyone could watch it and know whats going on and enjoy it. They dont need to know the ins and outs of Batman, Joker, or the crime bosses. It's much more grounded and thats a bit of what it was praised for back in 2008. Many liked that it took place in what seemed like an actual modern day city, and not the gothic comic book looking scenery.


>People watch the movie and talk about two things: The Joker and the scene where Batman goes and gets Lau.

And your point is??

>Everything other thing people talk about, the bank heist, the burning of the money, the hospital scene, etc, all center around The Joker.

Yes, all scenes within the movie. Would you have seen it as a great movie if all that was Batman rather than the Joker?

Sometimes certain performances make a movie. They propel a movie past what it would have been without that performance and you know that by how much better that performance is than any other in the film. Think R Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket, Nicholson in A Few Good Men, etc. Those movies are good on their own but with that performance they are lifted up. That doesn't make the script, the editing, the VFX, the set design, etc better, it just makes the movie viewed as better than the sum of its parts because one aspect is so well done. 

>The story is basic for sure, but thats what makes it work.

The story is basic, period. It all works because Ledger brought a once in a lifetime performance to an otherwise ""basic"" movie. He lifts what would have been a basic movie and a lackluster follow up to Batman Begins to another level because of his performance. 

>Yes, all scenes within the movie. Would you have seen it as a great movie if all that was Batman rather than the Joker?

Two answers: First, It's not ""all the scenes"", Ledger is only in the movie 30 mins, that leave 2 hours of the movie that people rarely discuss. Second, I see Batman Begins as a great movie and it is almost all Batman. 

>Doesn't seem all that different than how it was back in 1989 when people talked about scenes that Jack Nicholson was in as the Joker

But that also made sense because Nicholson was literally in more of the movie than Keaton was. 

We agree on The Batman, it was better than BvS but the brooding Batman character only gets you so far. Dano was a cheap imitation of Ledgers Joker and it just didn't work for me to the level it did for others. We can agree to disagree on The Dark Knight as well, because I think it is highly overrated and you think it is ""an almost perfect film"", I don't really see you giving up on that stance.",-2,1661956125.0

Right, but what does that even matter? They are part of the movie. Its not like there is an option to remove that character and performance from the movie, and suddenly you get left with a mediocre movie.

>That doesn't make the script, the editing, the VFX, the set design, etc better, it just makes the movie viewed as better than the sum of its parts because one aspect is so well done.

Sure, but in this instance, I'm saying I enjoyed the script, the visuals, the scenery, the music, the pacing, the characters, the dialogue,the stunts, the direction, etc. To me that all makes for a near perfect movie. You are isolating one element of that and claiming thats what made the movie anything at all.That may be true for some people, I look at a movie as a whole. I embrace the various elements of the filmmaking. 

>The story is basic, period. It all works because Ledger brought a once in a lifetime performance to an otherwise ""basic"" movie. He lifts what would have been a basic movie and a lackluster follow up to Batman Begins to another level because of his performance.

And thats all your opinion. I don't see it as just one performance that holds the entire film together. He did a great performance, no doubt about that. I can't say that Oldman sucked in his part. I can't say Bale was horrible. I can't say Eric Roberts didn't add a fun villain vibe to it. I cant say Eckhart was terrible as Two-Face. I certainly can't knock Michael Caine for his performance.

>It's not ""all the scenes"",

I mean't all his scenes are within the movie. 

>that leave 2 hours of the movie that people rarely discuss.

I haven't come across any of those people.  One scene that I constantly heard people bring up time and time again, was where Batman heads off to save Dent. Many thought he was going to get Rachel. Thats a scene that really stuck with people because  of the surprise of who he went to save.

>Second, I see Batman Begins as a great movie and it is almost all Batman.

Yea, that was the Batman origin story. Naturally, it'd be Bruce Wayne/Batman for the majority.  The Dark Knight was about Batman going after the mob. 

>But that also made sense because Nicholson was literally in more of the movie than Keaton was

He could have been in the movie for all of 15 minutes, it was his performance that stood out.  Though that was the showcase for all those 90s Batman movies. The villains were the focus of each movie. Batman is hardly in Batman Returns, yet to this day there are people that adore that film and refer to it as the best Batman movie ever made.

>I think it is highly overrated and you think it is ""an almost perfect film"", I don't really see you giving up on that stance.

I am a movie fan. I enjoy all the various aspects that go into the making of a movie. From that initial conceptualization, to the editing, to the final product, etc. etc. I see The Dark Knight as a well made movie. Same as how I see The Karate Kid as a near perfect movie. You may think both of those films are terrible films that aren't even worth mentioning. I'm not just talking about actor performances. I can go into the music cues, the camera angles, the lightning, the use of shadows, the color timing, the costume design, the props, practical effects, CGI, fight choreography, etc. etc.  All that combined is what makes a movie for me. 

You may have only taken shine to one actor's performance, and thats fine, but thats your take on the movie, not mine.",2,1661957811.0

>For Nolan’s urban-set comicbook blockbuster, the London-born director actually screened Mann’s L.A. crime drama for all his department heads before going into production.

>“I always felt ‘Heat’ to be a remarkable demonstration of how you can create a vast universe within one city and balance a very large number of characters and their emotional journeys in an effective manner,” Nolan says.

>IGN: So is that where you got the idea to cast William Fichtner as the bank manager in your robbery sequence? From Heat?

>Nolan: [Laughs] Yeah, I know! Exactly! It's a bit of a nod to that. He's just an incredible talent and I wanted somebody who'd jump off the screen in our first six minutes because he's really the only face you see for most of it.",656,1633869399.0

When obviously they planned the whole film out from the start as it was a sequel in a planned trilogy
  
But I have heard of that happening with some movies. The opening scene began as a short film and then was so well received that they used it as a springboard for a feature length movie
  
Like Whiplash began that way, as a short film. And The Babadook. And Sin City. And District 9. And Office Space. And The Evil Dead. And Napoleon Dynamite.
  
Fuck it I'm just gonna link an article about it instead of listing them all like this, cos this is apparently even more common than I thought.

The horse on the tracks is heading for a collision course with the train. The horse could move and avoid the collision, but it won't. It doesn't understand how to. This is McCauley (De Niro's character) in Heat. He only knows one life. One way of being. He's the horse who will stay on the tracks regardless of the result.

All that just wasn't well executed and instead they went back to ""lets put them in another prison"" which also didn't work. After S3 it was just more convoluted shit.

The series creator even left saying he no interest going further. 

Then the CW brought someone else in and the show plummeted so badly that the original creator came back just so they'd stop butchering his creation. 

If they'd left it just at season 5's end that show would've had one of the best endings of all time. Sam  sacrifices himself, Dean gets his family he always wanted, Bobby is alive and closer to Dean to the point he's basically Dad 2.0, and Castiel is off being Castiel. 

The whole ""was chuck God!?"" or just a ""prophet that was transported by the arch-angel protecting him"" thing could've been a fun little fan theory. 

But no. We had to get season 6 through 8. Where they fucking ***killed*** Bobby off in the worst ways prossible. 

Then shit just went off the rails while jumping the shark and somehow adding a baby who doesn't stay a baby very long at all.

It's like they wanted to ruin it on purpose. 

I tapped out after the way Dean beat Eve, the Mother of Monsters. That was the dumbest ass pull in that show by a mile. Plus it was so anticlimactic. Like holy fuck THAT'S how the Mother of Monsters, the being that created every spooky thing not demon, spirit, or angel, dies?

Dark Knight feels like a natural extension of BB. Pretty much right where we left off

But then DKR comes in and is like, oh, the League is gonna burn Gotham again, sorta, because Gotham is super corrupt at the top. It may also look really nice all around, but don't be fooled! There's a secret underworld... That we created.

Batman comics have addressed this in more recent years with retconning Thomas Wayne into a more villainous/dark character, and the more recent Court of Owls stuff.

It looks like that might finally be making its way into the movies with some of the stuff in the trailers for The Batman.

Zorro fought the racist government abusing the natives. Love Bill Finger and he obviously got screwed and didn't mean to, but he kinda white washed Zorro. Frank Miller brought it back to where it should have always been.

Not too sure this holds water. On like a super surface level sure… Ra’s Al Ghul thinks corruption and crime is bad. That’s not a controversial take. It’s explicitly his methods that are a problem. Talia and Bane are a worse version, since their true motive seems to be revenge. 

And The Joker makes similar obvious, uncontroversial points, like the fact that we are desensitized to violence that we expect. That’s not what makes him a villain, it’s his *response* to that.

Which is technically true -- the villains see a flaw in society, and overcorrect by doing evil shit -- Gotham is corrupt; Ra's believes the only way to fix Gotham is to destroy Gotham, the Joker believes that he must show the true chaotic face hidden behind the fabric of society, Talia believes the same thing as Ra's.

He then asserts that by extension, this must mean that the hero is wrong by upholding the corrupt society. He's effectively saying that ""oh the villains have to be given their murderous character so we don't root for them"".

This is where I think his argument is flawed -- the villains having a valid reason to be upset doesn't make it right, and the hero stopping them doesn't make it wrong. 

They went into this in TDK -- the GOOD side was Harvey Dent's, where he was fighting against the corrupt politicans and cops ruled by the mob. That's the entire point of the Dent plot! To show that there's an alternative to Ra's 'burn it all down' approach and the Joker's 'revealing the true face of Gotham' approach, and to show Bruce agreeing. 

The hero is agreeing with the correct way to solve the societal issue of corruption, and disagreeing with villain's methods of solving the societal issue. 

Just because the hero is a billionaire doesn't automatically make him wrong, just because Joker has a point doesn't make him right.

Ra's is not supposed to be a super-villan (à la Joker, Penguin, or Darkseid).  Ra's is supposed to be an Old World elite.  Someone that Errol Flynn might lock swords with. Ra's is the 1930's movie villain, and in Nolan's version he got turned into another supervillain (granted a ninja supervillain). 
* Ra's did not train Batman.  Doing this meant that you didn't get to see Ra's intelligence and power by deducing Batman's secret identity without having met him prior.
* I don't remember but does Nolan's Ra's commonly refer to Batman as ""Detective""?  Ra's alone of Batman's enemies refers to him by his intellectual function, not his superhero name.

I'm pretty sure there's a lot more conventional organized criminals hurting people than cops who break the law.

And if you want to roll with your Twitter-tier take on cops, Batman himself is a violent vigilante who breaks the law and hurts people all the time. He even has a gang. Multiple, depending on continuity.

Batman is an inherently malleable character. He can shift to fit a lot of different stories. The world changing doesn't make the character any less of a role model, fundamentally.

2332,hjb2pqe,"In The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Miranda Tate says ""you must invest if you wish to restore balance to the world"", this foreshadows that...","I’m not following your argument here. Your original thesis was that “actually, the villains were right and had noble goals.” But now in this post you’re saying “well of course the villains weren’t noble or sympathetic, they weren’t written that way in the script.”

There are plenty of examples of sympathetic villains. I’m not sure any in the Nolan trilogy fit that bill. Or at least not to the degree that we typically think of. 

One of the more common examples from modern film of a sympathetic villain who uses questionable means would be Killmonger from Black Panther. We explicitly see his tragic childhood and are meant to feel sorrow for it. We learn about his views and motivations with regards to race relations in the United States and the west as a whole. Then both we the audience *and* the film’s protagonist learn and grow by understanding that even if his methods were wrong, he had a point with regards to Wakandan isolationism, which comes to an close at the end of the movie.

Rhas Al ghul might be the closest we see, but I can’t really remember him giving an explanation other than “everything needs to be purged and reset for the greater good” which makes him closer to a Thanos than anything else. The joker is *explicitly* not a sympathetic character and is basically the embodiment of chaotic evil. There are multiple lines in the movie that explicitly *tell* the viewer this. Honestly, there’s a legitimate criticism to be made that Nolan gets a bit ham-fisted with breaking the “show, don’t tell” rule with the Joker and him being an avatar of chaos. But I guess clearly those criticisms are unfounded, since they were still lost upon you. In TDR, the only sympathetic “villain” we meet is cat woman, who ends up being more of an anti hero than a villain (if not an outright secondary protagonist). Bane and talia’s motivations aren’t any more noble than Rhas’s from the first film.

So I’m very confused how you went from point A “actually the villains were sympathic” to point B “well duh, they weren’t written in a sympathetic fashion” and calling the other poster an asshole in the process.",14,1636047076.0

He's very clearly fighting Wall Street types, and empowering the lower classes of Gotham against the wealthy who hold them down. In his stock exchange attack, his henchmen are disguised as janitors, shoe-shiners, and delivery drivers. There's a clear framing of class struggle in what he does. But then the script goes ""Um actually he's going to nuke the city and he didn't really mean any of that"". It feels like the writers suddenly realised that Bane's rhetoric can be sympathetic, so they flatten him into a one-dimensional mass murderer so Batman won't be philosophically or politically challenged.

It would have been far more interesting for Batman to fight someone who was quickly and violently empowering the people Batman wants to protect, and who weaponises the lower classes against people like Bruce Wayne.

Imagine if the third act of Black Panther started with Killmonger saying ""actually I don't care about racial conflict that was all lies, I'm going to shoot a laser into the sky and blow up Wakanda, and I'm actually working for another villain over there"".",3,1636051557.0

He's still basically an angry little boy.

And, of course, the story he tells about black oppression ignores how Wakanda ignored all the wars and unrest and black-on-black inhumanity in Africa itself. Should they have enforced some kind of Pax Wakanda? Should they have kept other black people from selling black slaves to whites? Erik - and his fangirls - never acknowledge all that. 

In the comics, one Black Panther literally stood on the wall of Wakanda and watched people starve outside.

From my memory, I never really took bane to really be a part of the class struggle. As you mentioned, it seemed more like a cover for holding the entire city hostage. But it’s entirely possible I missed something (I definitely watched that movie fewer times).

I do agree that your arc would be very interesting. Especially since Batman already is a vigilante working outside the law. Bane making the argument of “what makes you so different from me, working outside the law to achieve your goals?” would be compelling. Especially since Bruce Wayne is of course a billionaire. Bane would see him as an extension of the class warfare struggle. Whereas Batman sees himself as a benevolent billionaire who uses his wealth for good (by making toys to fight crime). 

There’s easily an argument to be made that Bruce is not using his wealth effectively if he truly cares about the struggling masses and is simply using it in the way that most assuages his own guilt/allows him to confront his own inner demons and sense of vengeance from the trauma he suffered as a child at the hands of a street thug who murdered his parents.",2,1636052598.0

I agree that he’s obviously lying to dent here. But his core motivations are still not the money (burning the mob’s pile of cash), he mentions multiple times it’s about sending a message, Alfred with the famous line about “some men just want to watch the world burn,” the scene where Batman has joker on the side of the hill sing hanging upside down by his foot and they discuss their yin and Yang etc.

His goal is to show that everyone is corruptible, everyone is one bad day away from becoming like him, that order is a sham and chaos is the true nature of things. He wants to up-end the status quo. He wants to poke holes in the thin veneer of order that the Gotham PD/DA office are trying to instill on a city with a long history of corruption.",3,1636052855.0
2398,hjbfqez,"In The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Miranda Tate says ""you must invest if you wish to restore balance to the world"", this foreshadows that...","I don’t think anyone claims killmonger’s motivations are perfect or that his logic is flawless. Simply that he is sympathetic. You do feel for him and his tragic childhood - he *is* a scared and angry boy who is still lashing out, you’re correct. It doesn’t justify his actions but it does help us understand - and sympathize with - his character.

But that doesn’t make any of his points about racial injustice invalid. Now his methods - which are bordering on turning Wakanda into a ruling black ethnostate - are the questionable part. Just because his idea and his means aren’t perfect doesn’t mean that they don’t have some underlying merit that influences our protagonist. I think there’s a big difference between “we can sympathize with the antagonist” and “actually the antagonist is entirely right and without flaws.”

The movie doesn’t really have the time - nor do I think it really serves to further any character arcs - to delve into any of the other instances that Wakanda has failed to intervene in. The core message - that Wakanda should end its isolationism and use its power, wealth, and resources for good - is still preserved. Erik is coming from an American upbringing, so of course most of his experiences and anger will be shaped by that.

The closest the movie really gets to this is the early scenes with Nakia doing undercover work in Nigeria which if I remember correctly was rescuing a bunch of people from human traffickers? But they are doing it covertly, to preserve Wakanda’s secret. That’s the status quo of Wakanda; helping, but doing so from the shadows. The film explicitly wants the protagonist and the audience to change their mindset on this and Killmonger is the vehicle to challenge that status quo.",2,1636052181.0

The character twist with Bane is similar to the one in Iron Man 3 for me; I can totally see how they could work, but because the hero's story is entwined with the villain's plot, the fake-out needs to be replaced with something interesting.

>Do I really look like a guy with a plan? ... You know what I am? I'm a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it! I just do things. The mob has plans. The cops have plans.

So when I say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal, you know I'm telling the truth. It's the schemers that put you where you are. You were a schemer, you had plans, and, uh, look where that got you.

>I just did what I do best. I took your little plan, and I turned it on itself. Look what I did to this city with a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets, hmm? You know what I noticed? Nobody panics when things go according to plan. Even when the plan is horrifying. If tomorrow I told the press that, like, a gang-banger would get shot, or a truckload of soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics. Because it's all part of the plan. But when I say that one little old mayor will die, well then everybody loses their minds!
