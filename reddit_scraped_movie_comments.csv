On her search for the truth, we see her at her weakest, her strongest, her sexiest, and her most vulnerable. And at the end, well the ending leaves a bit to be desired, but let‚Äôs just say we see her on top. \n\nWhat starts as an erotic and desirable suburban reflection of the nuclear family quickly follows Alice down the rabbit hole into a plot full of twists and turns that slowly but surely leads to one word: Patriarchy. Along the way, be prepared for the unexpected - with a dash of redundancy and predictability sprinkled in.

With the film harshly bordering between being eye-opening and overwhelming, I can definitely understand the split criticism that has been shared by movie critics. Blonde is a fictionalized biographical drama focusing on the short life of Norma Jeane Mortenson, also known as the iconic actress, Marilyn Monroe. Directed by Andrew Dominik and starring Ana de Armas in the titular role, the film is based on the novel of the same name by Joyce Carol Oates. As one of my most anticipated watches in September, my excitement towards finally watching the film quickly turned into shock as it did for many. If you\'ve yet to see the film, please note you should prepare yourself to either very passionately hate it or love it (you definitely won\'t come out of it feeling neutral)...""\n\nCheck out my full review below:\n\n[Blonde (2022) - Review](https://fanfirstreviews.home.blog/2022/10/04/blonde-2022-review/)\n\nLet me know what your thoughts are in the comments!

I left that night both satisfied and unsettled thanks to Crimes of the Future. Set in a not-so-distant dystopian future, this movie expresses the dichotomy of avant-garde vs. kitsch through the idea of art as the mutation (and subsequent removal) of human organs. \n\nBrace yourself for close-ups of flesh being cut open and tumors being handled like religious objects of reverence. If you can get by that, you can begin to appreciate what Director David Cronenberg is trying to do. The idea that both our individuality as well as our progress as humans should not be hindered or stymied by societal pressures and governmental agencies. That just because something is called wrong or broken (who came up with those labels anyway?) doesn‚Äôt mean we should accept it as such. That the only way we can move forward (and even survive) as humans is to do as our curious minds have always done and experiment. Go against the status quo! \n\nA very dark and cerebral screenplay is accompanied by a cutting and electric soundtrack brought to us by none other than the great Howard Shore. Shoutout to Viggo Mortensen who looked an awful lot like Strider in a couple shots as well as Kristen Stewart who crushed it as the nerdy fan girl. \n\nMovie: 6 / 10 Story: 7 / 10 Rewatchability: 4 / 10', Comment(id='iq7prer')]",3,1.0,1664347216.0

126,TIME TO TAKE LIMELIGHT AWAY FROM CELEBRITY,xfpe80,"['We have all most likely experienced an obsession over a celebrity at least once in our lifetime. Whether you went through a One Direction phase in middle school (complete with posters, signed albums, and band merch) or found yourself joining the BTS Army fanbase to closely obsess over the members‚Äô personal lives, you idolized these individuals and placed them on an untouchable pedestal. This is a fairly common experience; we all seem to have a tendency to divulge in the lives of others. While these tendencies have the potential to be healthy practices, putting life into perspective and allowing individuals to build communities based on their appreciation for certain individuals can also give rise to toxic obsessions and false idolizations. But are these the heroes we should be worshipping? Health and care workers are the foundation of health systems and the driving force to achieving universal health coverage and global health security. Their commitment and professionalism throughout the pandemic are evident to all: extraordinary people, performing extraordinary work. WHO estimates that between 80 000 and 180 000 health and care workers could have died from COVID-19 in the period between January 2020 to May 2021, converging to a medium scenario of 115 500 deaths. They are the real heroes and yet we were not aware of these figures. During the pandemic , they are the ones who have suffered and not the privileged upper class living in their lavish mansions. We need to realize that this is the end of an era for these celebrities and more media attention needs to be paid to the real heroes.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/xfpe80/video/a30uv9bpn7o91/player']",0,0.5,1663329685.0

131,BRAHMASTRA REVIEW| FUTURE OF BOLLYWOOD??,xbgtvu,"['FUTURE OF BOLLYWOOD?\n\nOk, this might be a very long and detailed review of the film ""BRAHMASTRA"" So as everyone knows what Brahmastra actually is the Brahmashirsha Astra was a weapon that was said to be able to destroy the world, capable of destroying creation and vanquishing all beings. So me being a huge fan of The Indian Cinema booked a ticket for the film Brahmastra with a lot of hopes and excitement.\n\nBut was the result worth the hype or expectations ??\n\nNO, the only good thing about the film is the CGI, no doubt it was the best input in the film but when you watch the film it\'s just like watching Ranbir Kapoor playing with fire with the help of VFX. Ranbir being the main lead and having one of the Astra should have an engaging and powerful character but Bollywood being Bollywood there are freaking hug scenes in the middle of the climax scene, in the middle of a fight scene, in the middle of a dance song like dance toh phir bhi theek hai par Ranbir is playing SHIVA but has no power and energy to play the role. Him describing Brahmastra like a ""gol Woh pizza jaisa"" this is the dialogue he delivered to describe the weapon which can destroy the bloody earth. I feel Ranbir Kapoor hasn\'t done justice to the role played by him, the character was so dull and the dialogue was the worst part about his character, if he is the AGNIASTRA he should act like one just like Naga sir and Big B did.\n\nNow let\'s talk about the main female lead who had only 3 dialogues.\n\n1. Screaming ""SHIVA SHIVA SHIVA"" 2. ""SHIVA TUMARA HAATH"" 3. Having romantic dialogues with Ranbir Kapoor That\'s all Alia Bhatt did in the film. The love chemistry between Ranbir and alia is good but itna chemistry bhi mat banoa ki tumahre chemistry ke karan hi Brahmand ka vinaash ho jaye. The over love story and melodramatic scenes are one of the reasons for the letdown of the film.\n\nRanbir and Alia : Look each other at Dussehra Meet at the club Fall in love at Ranbir\'s house\n\nThis is the love story about your PAPA AND MUMMA, FUTURE RANBIR AND ALIA BABY.\n\nThis love story happens in a span of 3 hours after their meeting and alia Bhatt being a south Bombay girl and ranbir being a normal guy, impress alia Bhatt in 3 hours makes her fall in love with her and gaining her trust like there is a legit dialogue where alia Bhatt says ""mei tumpe hamesha se bharosa karte thi"" like seriously behen 3 ghanta hue hai milke.\n\nAnd after being in love they go fight the villain of the film MOUNI ROY because Alia Bhatt is the button of Ranbir Kapoor\'s power Like button seriously it\'s the Brahmastra we are talking about.\n\nThe STORY There is to be honest no story in the film, if a film is being made on the most powerful weapon there should be a proper description of why this particular Astra is with SRK, Naga sir, or Ranbir Kapoor but no there are details given about that, there is no accurate detail about the Astras and just complete bullshit throughout the whole story.\n\nSo the story goes like ranbir a DJ and alia is a side chick fall in love like maadddllllyyyy in 3 hours and then they have to stop mouni roy from getting brahmastra since she needs to give it DEV her boss.\n\nSRK has one Astra Naga sir has one And our HERO RANBIR has ONE but the twist is Ranbir needs alia to use his Astra matlab kuch bhii, Ayan sir iss movie ko agar aap 11 years ki mehnat aur 410 crore ka investment bolts ho toh bhaii please leave Bollywood and start working under directors like SS, Prashant Neel, and Sanjay Leela Bhansali because if they had a budget like your film and the VFX then the movies which they would have made would have crossed 410 crores on its very first day.\n\nIn the end, they defeat MOUNI Roy and the movie basically says that ""BRAHMASTRA IS ALL ABOUT LOVE.""\n\nMouni roy actually did a fantastic job, she was very much into the character and was focused on getting the brahmastra for Dev her GOD.\n\nSHAH RUKH KHAN had a cameo of around 7 to 10 min but he took the show and the way he was talking about the Astra was everyone expecting from Ranbir Kapoor.\n\nBIG B STOLE THE SHOW AND THE SONG WAS PRETTY AVERAGE.\n\nOther than the VFX and good cameos there is nothing in the film. I would recommend not to spend Rs 75 on it even on WORLD CINEMA DAY.\n\nIt\'s a big No save your money and invest it in mutual funds or a better place because we will be needing it for part 2.', Comment(id='io1jivb')]",6,0.87,1662897917.0
132,Detachment (2011) Review,xbhch3,"["" \n\nAn amazing movie directed by Tony kaye\n\nThere are many things I liked about this movie, it shows us what really goes on in a high school , children are suffering (suicide, loneliness, misunderstanding) after all there are things more important than good grades and passing tests.\n\nMeredith suffers from a gap between her and her parents, but she found a father figure in Henry, unfortunately when faced with reality, she finds that she is meant to be alone with no connections, and when Henry tries to calm her, as if destiny intervenes and they are mistaken for being sexually involved. which leads to her suicide.\n\nThe kid who kills the cat, he has problems and according to him that is the only way to feel good, (without getting deep into psychology) but we understand that a sick misunderstood person usually prefers violence to heal himself /herself instead of talking or confronting the problem.\n\nIt also dives into the hardships we find in doing a good work ; the headmistress who struggles to do her job, she is afraid that she might be fired, and then we see her on the ground like she's craving death, her job took the best of her , she only thinks about the job and her image as a headmistress , despite having a good family and a husband who loves her.\n\nThe school doctor (Lucy Liu) who despite being a psychiatrist, feels that she's doing nothing, that she‚Äôs failing, I think that's she overwhelmed by what she sees and how there is suffering all around her and all what she can do is sit there helplessly watching\n\nHenry Barthes is a lonely man, who despite all the trauma he endured, wants to do the right thing, his character arc in the movie is almost a complete circle, he doesn‚Äôt get what he wants , (he failed to save the suicidal girl, and slightly improved the life of the school), however despite that , he made some changes, (that student who in the beginning hated him , we see that he was changed and appreciates him), . Henry is a character who doesn‚Äôt feel nothing for himself (when he said I‚Äôm like a bag without emotions) but he feels for others, instead of punishing the kid who killed the cat, he took him to the doctor, he sees and communicates with the beaten teacher, he tries to feel what his students are going through , he knows that they‚Äôre living a lie and they are not being true to themselves (he even made a reference to George Orwell‚Äôs 1984 which tells the story of people knowing that they live in a lie yet they chose to go with it). Henry claims he‚Äôs heartless and emotionless (doesn‚Äôt care about being insulted) , however he shows anger when he‚Äôs mistaken for a sex predator, he didn‚Äôt mind being called that but he didn‚Äôt like being compared to his grandfather who was the reason behind his mother‚Äôs suicide. In addition, it proves that Henry is a good person, because he chose to take care of his grandfather despite the horrific act he had done. Henry despite having Erica as a friend is meant to be alone, even his job as a sub teacher, gives the impression that whoever surrounds him will be temporary.\n\nErica doesn‚Äôt want a life of slavery , of sex, people who only like her because of her body, after all she‚Äôs still young , she‚Äôs still a kid and that was what Henry saw in her , He was the first one who took care of her and saw her as person, so she went along with him, maybe she wanted to change her life but failed before, now she has a second chance (like in stairway to heaven : there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run. There‚Äôs still time to change the road you‚Äôre on). Erica wants to change, but maybe she wasn‚Äôt given a good chance to do that but now she finally did it, she stopped her sex work""]",2,1.0,1662899451.0

140,Predator: Prey,x8bzp1,"[' The new Predator film ‚ÄòPrey‚Äô is a quality addition to a film series that‚Äôs has floundered in recent efforts. We follow Naru of the Comanches as she tries to prove herself a worthy hunter to her tribe. Facing off against wild beasts, foreign invaders and the ruthless Predator, she must prove that a keen mind is a better tool than strength in body or arms. \n\nThe film is set around the time of the European conquest of America. The setting is beautiful, as the tribe travels through wild grasslands and across mountain ranges of the Northern Great Plains. We get a feel for the scope and wildness of the plains. The Comanche tribe are hunter gatherers, living off the wild. They are living the same life that their ancestors have lived for thousands of years. They waste nothing, eating what they hunt and using the skins to build their clothes and houses. This is contrasted starkly with the savagery and wastefulness of the invaders later in the film. We are witnessing a great clash of peoples and ways of life. The Comanche represent nature and balance. The invaders represent consumption and greed. \n\nA key decider of status in the Comanches tribe is one‚Äôs ability to hunt. This skill benefits the tribe not only with food but as a method of defence against dangers such as bears and lions. The skill of the warriors is breath-taking. They are fast, agile and incredibly brave. They stand and battle their enemy, be it animal or alien, going toe to toe with the Predator multiple times. These fight scenes are my favourite parts of the film, showing off the potential of human strength and skill. However, in this patriarchal tribe, Naru is ostracised and ridiculed for wanting to be a hunter. She must go above and beyond the men around her to be accepted as she fights against not only sexism, but her lesser physical stature. We see throughout the film that Naru relies on her mind to outwit opponents. Her final success proves that determination and resourcefulness are just as important as physical strength. \n\nWe get little backstory on the Predator. After being dropped in by a ship, it spends all its time stalking the Comanches and the European invaders. Its tech is more primitive than in previous films, suggesting that the Predator race has upgraded their tech after this event, possibly to match the evolution of their human game. Interestingly, we see the Predator be very selective about when and how it fights. It matches the weapons it uses to the foe it faces. It uses a spear-like device to fight the Comanches. Against the gun wielding Europeans, it uses a shooting device and a vicious net to match theirs. When attacked by a bear it used only its physical strength and a knife, in a particularly gory and thrilling scene. The Predator celebrating a kill by soaking itself in the blood of the bear felt particularly visceral.\xa0We also see the Predator pass over Naru as she is caught in a bear trap. It seems that the Predator wants a challenge and a fair fight. It is a ruthless foe, the Predator, slaying multiple Comanche hunters and dozens of the Europeans. While we admire the skill and cunning of Naru in killing it, this only occurred after multiple grievous wounds, including a bear attack, a spear to the abdomen and a lost hand. It did not die easily. \n\nThe European invaders gives us a fascinating portrayal of the first colonisers and invasion of a foreign land. We experience everything through the eyes of the Comanches, so when some get caught by these invaders, it is terrifying. The invaders are brutish and dirty. They speak a foreign, unintelligible language. \xa0An interesting parallel can be made between the Predator and the foreign invaders. The Predator is a hyper-aggressive beast that glories in the taking of life. It has no love or respect for nature or living in balance with the land. It kills not to sustain itself but for the sport. Similarly, the Europeans are vicious, sadistic and wasteful. We share in the horror Naru feels when she discovers all the bison killed and skinned, their corpses left to rot. This scene is particularly effective as we are led at first into believing this is the work of the Predator. When Naru and her brother are captured, her brother is tortured and it takes little imagination to guess what would have become of Naru had she not escaped. These men are cruel and evil. Perhaps this is a metaphor for the colonisation of America, or maybe the evils of human nature. \n\nPrey is a fantastic film. It blends action and horror in a story that rivals the first film in the series. The messages of equality and respecting nature are particularly relevant to todays world.']",1,0.6,1662573887.0

165,Would love to hear feedback as I‚Äôm starting a movie/TV review blog and this is my first post! SPOILERS FOR CHA CHA REAL SMOOTH AHEAD.,x0rbof,"['B Grade\nTLDR; Cha Cha Real Smooth is a quirky, down to earth, look into Cooper Raiff as a writer and carves out a road filled with big potential.\n\nCha Cha Real Smooth is the Sophomore release of the breakout writer, director Cooper Raiff. It‚Äôs a poignant look into the life of Andrew, a young, early 20s guy just trying to ‚Äúfigure it out‚Äù as his girlfriend moves overseas and leaves him stuck living with his family and working a dead end job. As per the syllabus, I am an absolute SUCKER for a good Coming-of-Age story and Cha Cha Real Smooth proves to be a solid entry in that department.\n\nThere‚Äôs many story elements to this film I could talk about and they mostly work, but neither you nor I have the time to dive deep into that. So I‚Äôll focus in on what I think Cooper Raiff is trying to convey through all the different story beats.\n\nI believe Cooper is honing in on the development/maturity of the main character Andrew because Andrew ultimately acts as a metaphor for Cooper‚Äôs own journey into filmmaking and how Cooper is coming to accept this newfound fame. PFor Andrew‚Äôs story, his relationship with his family, Domino and Lola, and his awkward career path feel as though they are just filler. Filler that more often works because it accentuates Andrews quirky personality and ultimately drives Andrew towards the conclusion of his story where he comes to accept where he is in his life, despite the loss suffered on the way. \n\nBased on the performance Cooper gives, Andrew, as a character, feels as though he was ripped straight out of Coopers in real life personality. Now I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily claim that Andrew is an exact depiction of Coopers real life struggles and aspirations (or maybe Cooper is into older women, ya never know and I‚Äôm not here to judge that). Yet, looking deeper into Andrew‚Äôs story, I can‚Äôt help but think that Andrew‚Äôs innocent pull towards the ‚Äúunachievable‚Äù woman is a metaphor for Coopers early aspirations as a filmmaker. Andrew begins as a lost soul with a passionate drive and devotion towards those he loves and the goals he wishes to achieve. This makes him incredibly relatable as the main protagonist of the film. This relatability acts in the films favor as it amplifies the emotional impact when that which Andrew is trying to obtain (moving overseas to be with his ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù or a romantic relationship with Domino) ultimately falls apart. As the story comes to a head, Andrew realizes that the pieces of his life that he loved yet treated as a ‚Äúmeans to an end‚Äù (his relationship with Lola and with his brother/mother) ends up being the keys that unlocks his potential, leading him straight to his ‚Äúbittersweet‚Äù ending.\n\nThe story itself is formulaic and has moments of clumsy dialogue but it is well-crafted and, quite frankly, expertly acted. I want to especially shout out Vanessa Burghardt who took on the role as Lola and, as someone who currently works in the field of mental health, perfectly portrayed the unspoken struggles of someone with Autism. I‚Äôm definitely excited to see where she goes in her career considering this role is her first major role. Kinda gives me ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Eating Gilbert Grape‚Äù vibes‚Ä¶ I know‚Ä¶ Huge comparison. \n\nWhen I view this story thorough a metaphorical lens that offers us a glimpse into who Cooper Raiff is as a filmmaker and a general person, I feel more connected and impacted by the story. With this in mind, I‚Äôm awarding Cooper Raiff a B for a solidly told and well acted coming-of-age drama that succeeded in leaving me satisfied in the destination of Andrew‚Äôs journey to emotional maturity. I‚Äôm also excited to see where Cooper goes from here. Preferably I‚Äôd love to see him tackle a story that breaks him out of his comfort zone and gives us a chance to see Cooper‚Äôs skills as a writer/director. I‚Äôll for sure be rooting for him.']",1,1.0,1661786215.0

Also, there¬¥s a scene at nigh where he gets trapped in a car until the morning. Also, the movie happens in places with much snow. Also, i think that at the end a man that works in the orphanage takes this little kid for some sort of road trip, and they see on tv the news about his father being arrested. According to my brother, the actor that plays the dad looks like Jean Reno and the actor that plays the kid looks like Atticus Shaffer. I think there¬¥s also a scene where the kid imagines a horror story in which the fathers sell his kid in exchange for money and then regret it, but when they ask for the children back they only send them his fingers.

I think it\'s safe to say I wasn\'t disappointed! With the main cast returning to reprise their roles, the sequel has some wonderful new additions including Idris Elba as Knuckles and Colleen O\'Shaughnessey as Tails (my personal favourite). It\'s been surprisingly fun watching the expansion of the Sonic universe and seeing each iconic character being added to the films has been exciting.

Marvel should focus more on the stories that matter instead of creating new characters to please the groups that push too hard for a change that doesn‚Äôt need to happen.\nAt the end of it all quite a boring series, with some decent highs that make you almost want to sit up, but ultimately keeps you down in your seat while you start to daydream away from the screen. Not to mention it lacks that real hero vibe, with shaky comedy and annoying performances. \n98% critic reviews, really ? Endgame/Ragnarok/Moon Knight/Infinity War/No way Home/WandaVision/Loki/Hawkeye/Winter Soldier/Civil War/Homecoming/Iron-Man. Even Iron-Man 2 deserves a higher score.

224,Valhalla Rising (2010) Film Review,wnneah,"['867/1,000 matastars\n\n\nValhalla Rising is a film, it is a visual depiction of suffering, emptiness, torture, fasting, and fog. \n\n\nThis review covers the first three parts of the film, the visual depiction of the aforementioned themes.\n\n\nMads puts the D in dark age. Like our current dark age, like many of today‚Äôs office workers, Mads spends most of his day in his small cell of a home, his food is delivered, he naps for long periods punctuated by short bursts of intense work. But Mads doesn‚Äôt earn his pay via virtual meetings, he does it the old school way, killin‚Äô his opponents in the mud ring, tied to the killin‚Äô pole, in a fog swept grey grassy hell.\n\n\nMads appears to be living in a fairly distant past or a yet to be seen dystopian future. They say that history repeats itself, and if it does, I hope I am not on the same continent as Mads when that time comes. Mads is the ultimate Stoic; forget Epictetus, unlearn Marcus Aerelius,\n\n\nMads alone holds the key to putting up with the less than ideal events of daily life.\n\n\nWe are more than our jobs but in modern society it‚Äôs hard not to let our jobs define us. People ask, ‚ÄúWhat do you do?‚Äù and a common answer is, ‚ÄúI am a designer‚Äù or, ‚ÄúI am a‚Ä¶‚Äù. In this regard Mads is the modern man. He is his job. He IS a fighter.\n\n\nMads has less than two eyes, which doesn‚Äôt seem to affect his ability to land a punch. You would think his lack of vision in his left eye would leave him exposed, but he seems to disregard his disability. Mads is a mixed martial artist. He favors striking but is known to implement grappling and ground work.  He fights with a devil may care lightness of foot and is equally strong with his right and left hands, a rare trait in any boxer, but he really shines when he adds the killin‚Äô pole rope to his repertoire. A few loops and a tug and dinner is served. Set it and forget it.\n\n\nSpeaking of dinner, Mads‚Äô diet appears to consist of a cloudy bowl of watered down milk with a couple solid thingies floating in the swirl. Mentioned previously, and like our reader, Mads meals are delivered to his door. This must be a point of frustration for Mads. Not so much the concept of delivery, which admittedly is convenient considering Mads is locked in a wooden cage when not fighting, but more so the execution of delivery, specifically the ladling of the soup, as Mads‚Äô food deliverer repeatedly spills a considerable portion of the soup while serving it.\n\n\nOne must note though that one would likely also have shaky hands while serving Mads. \n\n\nMads eats once per day or possibly after each death match. An athlete of Mads‚Äô height, weight, and age would probably need to consume upwards of three thousand calories per day at minimum to perform at a high level. \n\n\nMads performs at a high level.\n\n\nNeedless to say his soup must be loaded with protein, high in calories, and rich in amino acids. Electrolytes would be a must to fend off cramps while fighting and to round out the diet it would be best to include a potassium supplement for good measure, which alludes to the possibility that the solid chunks in Mads soup could be sliced banana.\n\n\nOne thing is certain. The climate of Mads‚Äô locale is not conducive to growing bananas.\n\n\nMads is an intermittent faster, his cholesterol would assumedly be low, as would his glucose. \n\n\nMads is not diabetic.\n\n\nA little back story: getting back to the eye, or lack thereof. That was not a sentence. This is. For those who do not know, there is a Norse god, Odin, the alpha male of the great mead hall located in Valhalla. Some have reported that Odin was missing an eye, that said eye had been picked out by a raven. Odin was also considered to be wise although I‚Äôm not sure by what measure. As we know, Mads is missing an eye, which begs the question: is Mads Odin? Mads certainly does not appear to be in Valhalla yet as there certainly does not appear to be any mead halls in his locale, nor bananas.\n\n\nValhalla is ‚Äúthe‚Äù place to be for dead Norse fighters. It‚Äôs a place to drink mead and other alcoholic beverages with the men you killed in your earthly life, toasting your former enemies, and acting like a fool. As a show of hands, who would want to get drunk with their enemies? \n\n\nMads does not act like a fool.\n\n\nMads has certainly sent many enemies to Valhalla and probably some non-enemies as well. Watching the film, Valhalla Rising, the subject of this review, the visual depiction of the aforementioned themes, one gets the sense that Mads/Odin would be sitting alone at the mead hall.\n\n\nMads does not come across as being someone to get invited to join the others in the drinking of mead.']",1,1.0,1660421257.0

Boba Fett is emasculated, the side characters are a joke, the action scenes are unwatchably inane, and the plot manages to both make no sense and also go nowhere. It‚Äôs hard to make a character as cool as Boba Fett look weak and incompetent but this show does it constantly. Don‚Äôt expect to understand what‚Äôs at stake or what the character motivations are, because they‚Äôre constantly being thrown out with no forethought or reasoning. No matter how much you like Star Wars or how little you like to use your brain while watching shows, this one will still have you scratching your head at some point.\n\nClosest comparison: It‚Äôs like The Mandalorian, but worse.\n\nSetting: Sci-Fi  \nPlot: Adventure  \nTone: Fantasy\n\nMore reviews at [The Boneyard](https://www.boneyardlimited.com/movie-reviews)']",0,0.25,1660329840.0

Fight Club was not a Family Movie. Fight Club was a movie to be watched in silence, attentive, focused, with a popcorn and a soda, not a diet soda, a real soda, or your favorite brand of home made soap.\n\nFight Club was in theaters before the industry was taken over by capes, before every live action movie was the screen version of a super band, loaded with talent but lacking in creativity.\n\nSadly, Fight Club might not have made it into major theaters today. It was produced before a time when theatrical releases devolved into the regurgitation of existing ‚Äúbrands‚Äù, ‚Äúhalfdaptations‚Äù of once original movies. \n\n\nFight Club was produced before the current era of the reboot, which is in dire need of a hard reset.\n\nLike today‚Äôs cape movies though, Fight Club was based on a book although not of the comic type. A book with words, with sentences, and with paragraphs.\n\n\nWelcome to Fight Club. The first rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club.', Comment(id='ij9nolv'), Comment(id='ijanpso'), Comment(id='ijb8zg7'), Comment(id='ijbg0ai')]",0,0.5,1659818036.0
262,RRR (2022) Film Review,whqxc2,"['947/1,000 matastars\n\n\nRRR: three letters, three words, undefinable.\n\nBut here is an attempt:\n\nRRR will leave you feeling unstoppable. Period. \n\nRRR is the best action movie of 2022. This movie is what the world has needed for a long time. By telling its tale of revolt and overcoming adversity, it helps us face some of the challenges of today: climate change, Covid, geopolitical uncertainty, pervasive malaise, divisiveness, tribalism, obesity, and ever rising inflation.\n\nWatch RRR and let the transformation happen. You will be left with hope and confidence for the future of mankind.\n\nBut it will be a journey. Within the first 15 minutes of the film you will know who the bad guys are, and they are despicable bastards. Enjoy the following two and a half hours as the full story unfolds.\n\nA major theme of the film and a source of conflict driving the story is the budding friendship between two opposites. Friendship between two men cannot become closer than that experienced between Bheem and Raju. Their wives would undoubtedly have had to set aside scheduled times for the two men to go their separate ways and spend time with their families, otherwise the piggy back rides, motorcycle vs. horse races, dancing, and wingmanning would never end.\n\n\nRRR is a story of friendship, family, duty, revolution, and reclamation in the face of greed, bigotry, empire, and waste.']",2,0.75,1659799686.0

If Doctor Frankenstein wasn‚Äôt strange I don‚Äôt know what strange is, and in spite of all of the strange things those doctors did, the world did not say, ‚ÄúYou shall be called Doctor Strange!‚Äù And those various strange doctors certainly did not have the self awareness to name themselves as strange.Is Doctor Strange a hero? He appears to live in the world of superheroes. It might have been worse if he had been called, ‚ÄúStrange Man‚Äù. Who wants to watch a movie about a strange man? And strange how? Does Strange Man do exceptional things? Does he save people? If he does, there has to be something overwhelmingly strange about him for people to continue to see that as his singular, overriding, defining quality.How about, ‚ÄúDoctor Unusual‚Äù or, ‚ÄúDoctor Peculiar‚Äù.Finally, who has the moral authority to label him strange?
